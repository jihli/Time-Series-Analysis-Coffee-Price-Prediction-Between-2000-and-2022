About the dataset:

Coffee
Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. 
From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. 
The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee
